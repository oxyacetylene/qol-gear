Place your compiled mods into the rev2_mods folder

## Current changelist:

### JAM:

- MAX Ryuujin now wallsticks from most places on the screen on normal hit (she needs it)

- Hochifu has a second input: 214S. Both inputs work for most things. Yes I understand that putting it on a 4 input was a bad idea.

- Zekkei (46P) has a slight adjustment to the angle it causes the opponent to send at and some more untech time, which should make its combos more consistent, maybe, kind of, probably, I'm not a Jam player.



### SOL:

- Bandit Bringer has a second input: 214H. Both inputs work.

- j.D is now attack level 4 (+1 from original) and has 30 untech time (+1 from original) to more closely match older Gear games and hopefully make dustloops easier.

- 5K is now 3 frames startup just for fun

- Bandit Revolver first hit now pushes out further, should result in fewer reverse hits

#### Planned:

- 

### LEO

- 2D sends Leo farther, should make f.S combo into 2D from farther out

- 5K is jump cancellable

- 6P now gatlings to c.S, f.S, 2H, 5H, 6H

- Leo's ETC file is currently vanilla. It doesn't need to be compiled.

#### Planned:

- bt.214S bigger hitbox upwards

### RVN (Raven)

- 

#### Planned:

- Scratch gives excitement on block

- 6P jump cancellable
