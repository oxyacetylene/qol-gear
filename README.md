# qol-gear
 Quality of Life changes for every character in Guilty Gear Xrd

## Build instructions:

Must be compiled with BBScript; can be found here: https://github.com/super-continent/bbscript

--- 

## Current changelist:

#JAM:

-MAX Ryuujin now wallsticks from most places on the screen on normal hit (she needs it)

-Hochifu has a second input: 214S. Both inputs work for most things. Yes I understand that putting it on a 4 input was a bad idea.

-Zekkei (46P) has a slight adjustment to the angle it causes the opponent to send at and some more untech time, which should make its combos more consistent, maybe, kind of, probably, I'm not a Jam player.



#SOL:

-Bandit Bringer has a second input: 214H. Both inputs work.

-j.D is now attack level 4 (+1 from original) and has 30 untech time (+1 from original) to more closely match older Gear games and hopefully make dustloops easier.
