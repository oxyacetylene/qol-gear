 Quality of Life changes for every character in Guilty Gear Xrd

## Build instructions:

Must be compiled with BBScript; can be found here: https://github.com/super-continent/bbscript

--- 

## Current changelist:

JAM:
MAX Ryuujin now wallsticks from most places on the screen on normal hit (she needs it)
Hochifu has a second input: 214S. Both inputs work for most things. Yes I understand that putting it on a 4 input was a bad idea.
Zekkei (46P) has a slight adjustment to the angle it causes the opponent to send at and some more untech time, which should make its combos more consistent, maybe, kind of, probably, I'm not a Jam player.
